  \frametitle{Summary}
  Abstraction of analytical models against detailed tools within the Used Fuel 
  Disposition campaign will  provide a generic geology repository model which is  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item efficient,
    \item modular,
    \item and dominant physics based,
  \end{itemize}
  for suitable integration with top level fuel cycle systems analysis tools in 
    support of dynamic fuel cycle analysis of waste driven metrics.
