% Overview : 
% put a repository model into cyclus
% that is capable of distinguishing between disposal choices
% and fuel cycle choices
% but is still speedy.

  \frametitle{Methodology : Modularity }
  A modular repository framework facilitates 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item  interchangable subcomponents (e.g. buffer material) so that 
      the impact on the disposal system performance may be observed
    \item and simulations with varying levels of detail.
  \end{itemize}
 \pause
  Integration with a fuel cycle simulator facilitates
  \begin{itemize}
    \item analysis of feedback effects upon the fuel cycle
    \item and investigation of fuel cycle choices on disposal system 
      performance.
  \end{itemize}
