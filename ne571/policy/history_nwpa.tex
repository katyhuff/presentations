  Passed through congress in 1982, it was signed into law in January, 1983 by

    This legislation defined the Federal Governmentâ€™s responsibility to provide 
    permanent disposal in a deep geologic repository for spent fuel and high-level

    responsibility to locate, build, and operate a repository for such wastes.
