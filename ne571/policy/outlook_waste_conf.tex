    \frametitle{Waste Confidence}
    To license a reactor or approve a reactor license extension, the NRC 
    requires a Waste Confidence clause. It is a section of the application that 
    assures the NRC that waste produced by the applying facility will be dealt 
    with. 

    Previous to the closing of the Yucca Mountain Project, all applicants for 
    reactor licenses and license extensinos were able to cite the nuclear waste 
    fund and the Yucca Mountain Project. 

    This is no longer the case.

        possibility thatcannot be ignored.'' \cite{sentelle_petitions_2012}
