Utilizing the mathematical structure present in {JFNK}, physics expressions are modularized into “Kernels,” allowing for rapid production of new simulation tools. In addition, systems are solved implicitly and fully coupled, employing physics-based preconditioning, which provides great flexibility even with large variance in time scales.

	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008PhDT........99F},
	abstract = {This study investigated the neutronic characteristics of the Pebble Bed Advanced High Temperature Reactor ({PB}-{AHTR}), a novel nuclear reactor concept that combines liquid salt (7LiF-{BeF}2---flibe) cooling and {TRISO} coated-particle fuel technology. The use of flibe enables operation at high power density and atmospheric pressure and improves passive decay-heat removal capabilities, but flibe, unlike conventional helium coolant, is not transparent to neutrons. The flibe occupies 40\% of the {PB}-{AHTR} core volume and absorbs ˜8\% of the neutrons, but also acts as an effective neutron moderator. Two novel methodologies were developed for calculating the time dependent and equilibrium core composition: (1) a simplified single pebble model that is relatively fast; (2) a full 3D core model that is accurate and flexible but computationally intensive. A parametric analysis was performed spanning a wide range of fuel kernel diameters and graphite-to-heavy metal atom ratios to determine the attainable burnup and reactivity coefficients. Using 10\% enriched uranium ˜130 {GWd}/{tHM} burnup was found to be attainable, when the graphite-to-heavy metal atom ratio (C/{HM}) is in the range of 300 to 400. At this or smaller C/{HM} ratio all reactivity coefficients examined---coolant temperature, coolant small and full void, fuel temperature, and moderator temperature, were found to be negative. The {PB}-{AHTR} performance was compared to that of alternative options for {HTRs}, including the helium-cooled pebble-bed reactor and prismatic fuel reactors, both gas-cooled and flibe-cooled. The attainable burnup of all designs was found to be similar. The {PB}-{AHTR} generates at least 30\% more energy per pebble than the He-cooled pebble-bed reactor. Compared to {LWRs} the {PB}-{AHTR} requires 30\% less natural uranium and 20\% less separative work per unit of electricity generated. For deep burn {TRU} fuel made from recycled {LWR} spent fuel, it was found that in a single pass through the core ˜66\% of the {TRU} can be transmuted; this burnup is slightly superior to that attainable in helium-cooled reactors. A preliminary analysis of the modular variant for the {PB}-{AHTR} investigated the triple heterogeneity of this design and determined its performance characteristics.},

	abstract = {Jacobian-free Newton–Krylov ({JFNK}) methods are synergistic combinations of Newton-type methods for superlinearly convergent solution of nonlinear equations and Krylov subspace methods for solving the Newton correction equations. The link between the two methods is the Jacobian-vector product, which may be probed approximately without forming and storing the elements of the true Jacobian, through a variety of means. Various approximations to the Jacobian matrix may still be required for preconditioning the resulting Krylov iteration. As with Krylov methods for linear problems, successful application of the {JFNK} method to any given problem is dependent on adequate preconditioning. {JFNK} has potential for application throughout problems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations and integro-differential equations. In this survey paper, we place {JFNK} in context with other nonlinear solution algorithms for both boundary value problems ({BVPs}) and initial value problems ({IVPs}). We provide an overview of the mechanics of {JFNK} and attempt to illustrate the wide variety of preconditioning options available. It is emphasized that {JFNK} can be wrapped (as an accelerator) around another nonlinear fixed point method (interpreted as a preconditioning process, potentially with significant code reuse). The aim of this paper is not to trace fully the evolution of {JFNK}, nor to provide proofs of accuracy or optimal convergence for all of the constituent methods, but rather to present the reader with a perspective on how {JFNK} may be applicable to applications of interest and to provide sources of further practical information.},

By using computational fluid dynamics ({CFD}) methods and employing simplified body center cubic ({BCC}) and face center cubic ({FCC}) model, pressure drop and local mean Nusselt number are calculated. The simulation result shows that the high Prandtl number molten salt in packed bed has unique fluid-dynamics and thermodynamic properties. There are divergences between {CFD} results and empirical correlations\&\#x2019; predictions of pressure drop and local Nusselt numbers. Local pebble surface temperature distributions in several default conditions are investigated. Thermal removal capacities of molten salt are confirmed in the case of nominal condition; the pebble surface temperature under the condition of local power distortion shows the tolerance of pebble in extreme neutron dose exposure. The numerical experiments of local pebble insufficient cooling indicate that in the molten salt cooled pebble bed reactor, the pebble surface temperature is not very sensitive to loss of partial coolant. The methods and results of this paper would be useful for optimum designs and safety analysis of molten salt cooled pebble bed reactors.},

	abstract = {The growing interest in energy applications of molten salts is justified by several of their properties. Their possibilities of usage as a coolant, heat transfer fluid or heat storage substrate, require thermo-hydrodynamic refined calculations. Many researchers are using simulation techniques, such as Computational Fluid Dynamics ({CFD}) for their projects or conceptual designs. The aim of this work is providing a review of basic properties (density, viscosity, thermal conductivity and heat capacity) of the most common and referred salt mixtures. After checking data, tabulated and graphical outputs are given in order to offer the most suitable available values to be used as input parameters for other calculations or simulations. The reviewed values show a general scattering in characterization, mainly in thermal properties. This disagreement suggests that, in several cases, new studies must be started (and even new measurement techniques should be developed) to obtain accurate values.},

	abstract = {There is a growing trend in nuclear reactor simulation to consider multiphysics problems. This can be seen in reactor analysis where analysts are interested in coupled flow, heat transfer and neutronics, and in fuel performance simulation where analysts are interested in thermomechanics with contact coupled to species transport and chemistry. These more ambitious simulations usually motivate some level of parallel computing. Many of the coupling efforts to date utilize simple code coupling or first-order operator splitting, often referred to as loose coupling. While these approaches can produce answers, they usually leave questions of accuracy and stability unanswered. Additionally, the different physics often reside on separate grids which are coupled via simple interpolation, again leaving open questions of stability and accuracy. Utilizing state of the art mathematics and software development techniques we are deploying next generation tools for nuclear engineering applications. The Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov ({JFNK}) method combined with physics-based preconditioning provide the underlying mathematical structure for our tools. {JFNK} is understood to be a modern multiphysics algorithm, but we are also utilizing its unique properties as a scale bridging algorithm. To facilitate rapid development of multiphysics applications we have developed the Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment ({MOOSE}). Examples from two {MOOSE}-based applications: {PRONGHORN}, our multiphysics gas cooled reactor simulation tool and {BISON}, our multiphysics, multiscale fuel performance simulation tool will be presented.},

	abstract = {A high temperature reactor ({HTR}) is a candidate to drive high temperature water-splitting using process heat. While both high temperature nuclear reactors and hydrogen generation plants have high individual degrees of development, study of the coupled plant is lacking. Particularly absent are considerations of the transient behavior of the coupled plant, as well as studies of the safety of the overall plant. The aim of this document is to contribute knowledge to the effort of nuclear hydrogen generation. In particular, this study regards identification of safety issues in the coupled plant and the transient modeling of some leading candidates for implementation in the Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative ({NHI}). The Sulfur Iodine ({SI}) and Hybrid Sulfur ({HyS}) cycles are considered as candidate hydrogen generation schemes.

Three thermodynamically derived chemical reaction chamber models are coupled to a well-known reference design of a high temperature nuclear reactor. These chemical reaction chamber models have several dimensions of validation, including detailed steady state flowsheets, integrated loop test data, and bench scale chemical kinetics. The models and coupling scheme are presented here, as well as a transient test case initiated within the chemical plant. The 50\% feed flow failure within the chemical plant results in a slow loss-of-heat sink ({LOHS}) accident in the nuclear reactor. Due to the temperature feedback within the reactor core the nuclear reactor partially shuts down over 1500 s. Two distinct regions are identified within the coupled plant response: (1) immediate {LOHS} due to the loss of the sulfuric acid decomposition section and (2) continuing slow {LOHS} due to the chemical species cascade throughout the plant.},
